## Introduction

If you've read my post about [scraping data from a Swedish museum's database](https://alpal923.github.io/2023/11/29/viking-data-scraping.html), you'll remember that I was left with two datasets in a language I can't read. This post will detail the process by which I transformed the data into something I could interpret better.

## Getting Started
### Setting the Stage with Essential Libraries
The journey begins with importing necessary Python libraries. The code sets up the environment by importing modules like os, pandas, google.cloud.translate_v2 (Google's translation API), and urllib. These libraries lay the groundwork for interacting with Google's translation services and handling data.

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
from google.cloud import translate_v2 as translate
from google.oauth2 import service_account
import json
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
import urllib.parse
```

### Configuring API Access
The next step involves configuring access to Google's translation API. This is done by reading a configuration file containing the project ID and API key. This step is crucial as it authenticates our access to Google's cloud services, ensuring secure and authorized interactions.

Google Cloud APIs do require payment. However, I was able to sign up for a trial for this small project.

```python
# Define the path to the file containing the project ID and API key
config_file = 'path_to_config_file'

# Initialize variables
project_id = None
api_key = None

# Read the project ID and API key from the file
with open(config_file, 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()

    # Extract project ID and API key
    project_id = lines[0].strip()
    api_key = lines[1].strip()
```

### Initializing the Translation Client
With the API access configured, the next code snippet initializes the translation client. This client acts as the bridge between our Python code and Google's translation services.

```python
# Initialize the translation client
translate_client = translate.Client()
```

## Translation
With the translator ready to go, I could begin the translation process. To reduce the number of calls I had to made and to speed up the process, I batched the text and cached the translations as I went.

```python
# Cache for storing translations
translation_cache = {}
```

### The Translation Function
The core of this notebook is a function for batch translation. This function, batch_translate_text_with_model, accepts target language, a list of texts, and an optional model parameter (defaulting to "nmt" for Neural Machine Translation). It translates each text and stores the result in a cache to avoid redundant translations, showcasing efficient and intelligent use of resources.


```python
def batch_translate_text_with_model(target: str, texts: list, model: str = "nmt") -> list:
    translated_texts = []
    for text in texts:
        if text in translation_cache:
            # Use cached translation if available
            translated_texts.append(translation_cache[text])
        else:
            if isinstance(text, bytes):
                text = text.decode("utf-8")

            result = translate_client.translate(text, target_language=target, model=model)
            translated_text = result["translatedText"]
            translation_cache[text] = translated_text
            translated_texts.append(translated_text)
    return translated_texts

# Apply translation
for column in text_columns:
    # Process the column in batches
    for i in range(0, len(df), batch_size):
        batch_slice = slice(i, i + batch_size)
        batch_texts = df[column][batch_slice].dropna()
        translated_batch = batch_translate_text_with_model('en', batch_texts.tolist())

        # Update only the rows that were translated
        df.loc[batch_texts.index, column + '_translated'] = translated_batch
```

## Final Cleaning
I noticed my dataset had a field called 'Datering' (the date range the artifact is expected to come from) which wasn't in a very useful format. I decided to split the column into two with just the years for Start and End.

```python
# Splitting the 'Datering' column into 'Era Start Year' and 'Era End Year'
df[['Era Start Year', 'Era End Year']] = df['Datering'].str.split(' â€“ ', expand=True)
```

I also wished to separate the dimensions in the Storlek column. I noticed there were sometimes multiple measurements of the same dimension (ie two or three lengths) and that the units were not standard. Breaking these values into parts and converting them to the same unit (mm for length, g for weight) was a rather simple task.

```python
# Conversion factors to millimeters for lengths and diameters, and to grams for weight
length_conversion_factors = {'mm': 1, 'cm': 10, 'm': 1000}
weight_conversion_factors = {'g': 1, 'kg': 1000}

# Function to extract and keep the largest measurements in mm and g
def extract_max_measurements(row):
    measurements = {
        'Width': None,
        'Length': None,
        'Thickness': None,
        'Diameter': None,
        'Weight': None
    }

    # Check if row is a string
    if not isinstance(row, str):
        return pd.Series(measurements)

    # Find all matches of measurements
    matches = re.findall(r'(Width|Length|Thickness|Diameter|Weight) (\d+(\.\d+)?) (mm|cm|m|g|kg)', row)
    for match in matches:
        measure_type, measure_value, _, unit = match
        measure_value = float(measure_value)
        if measure_type in ['Width', 'Length', 'Thickness', 'Diameter']:
            measure_value *= length_conversion_factors[unit]
        elif measure_type == 'Weight':
            measure_value *= weight_conversion_factors[unit]

        if measurements[measure_type] is None or measure_value > measurements[measure_type]:
            measurements[measure_type] = measure_value

    return pd.Series(measurements)
```

Lastly, I wanted to know what year teach artifact was uncovered, but the column for that wasn't formatted uniformly. 

```python
# Function to convert to year
def convert_to_year(date_str):
    try:
        return pd.to_datetime(date_str).year
    except:
        return date_str

# Apply the conversion
df['year'] = df['date_column'].apply(convert_to_year)
```

## Conclusion
This process allowed me to create a dataset more useful for the EDA and dashboard creation. While it wasn't perfect (some fields stayed Swedish) this is a much more usable set than before!
